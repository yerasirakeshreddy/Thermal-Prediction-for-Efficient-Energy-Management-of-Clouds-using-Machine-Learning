# Thermal-Prediction-for-Efficient-Energy-Management-of-Clouds-using-Machine-Learning
Managing the Temperature is an important issue in cloud data centres. In recent years, the use 
of cloud data centres had increased, and annual energy consumption has increased by 10%. 
Due to high utilization of the data centre, the temperature of the data centre host rises. In 
addition, temperature prediction due to thermal fluctuation is also an important issue. However, 
machine learning is a favourable approach for predicting temperature. 
Cloud data centres are extraordinary because of the enormous benefits that cloud computing 
offers. Modern cloud data centre servers have the capacity to consume up to 1000 watts of 
power, each reaching high peak temperatures. To minimize the risk of rising peak temperatures 
and significantly reduce power consumption, you need to accurately predict host heat 
dissipation and power consumption based on workload levels. 
Temperature prediction can be performed using machine learning techniques such as 
regression algorithms. It then uses scheduling algorithm to reduce the temperature of the host.
